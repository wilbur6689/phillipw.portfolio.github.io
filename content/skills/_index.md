# My Skills

This page contains segments of skills that I've developed or worked on over the years. Each segment highlights how I've developed the skill and in what environment. Some segments even contain tiny demonstrations.

## Skill Presentation Approach

**Each module:**
- Is small
- Is scannable
- Shows evidence
- Can be interacted with (hover, click, expand)

## Design Principles

### Skill Categories
Group skills by the types of problems you solve rather than by tools or buzzwords.

### Interactive Sections
Allow each category to expand, collapse, or reveal content through user interaction.

### Micro-Demos
Use very small visuals, animations, or code snippets to show a skill in action.

### Skill Tiles
Present each skill as a self-contained card that communicates capability at a glance.

### Evidence Over Claims
Anchor every skill to real work, experience, or outcomes instead of statements.

### Skill Filters
Let viewers toggle or filter skills to quickly find what's relevant to them.

### Skill Timelines
Show how skills have evolved or where they are actively used today.
