# My Skills Page

Skill Categories    
Group skills by the types of problems you solve rather than by tools or buzzwords.

Interactive Sections    
Allow each category to expand, collapse, or reveal content through user interaction.

Micro-Demos    
Use very small visuals, animations, or code snippets to show a skill in action.

Skill Tiles    
Present each skill as a self-contained card that communicates capability at a glance.

Evidence Over Claims    
Anchor every skill to real work, experience, or outcomes instead of statements.

Skill Filters    
Let viewers toggle or filter skills to quickly find what’s relevant to them.

Skill Timelines    
Show how skills have evolved or where they are actively used today.
