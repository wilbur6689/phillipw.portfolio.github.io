# Overview

# Phillips Portfolio

# [Github Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

The github page will be the foundation where I will build a personal portfolio. This personal website will contain various different pages to showcase what I’ve worked on, major projects, my communication skills, and other personal interests/hobbies that make up who I am. 

---

# Portfolio Flow

---

## **Homepage**

	The home page will showcase who I am and my mission statement. Use the homepage as a map, not a pitch deck

### Layout:

HERO

- Who am I?  
- What kind of work do I do?  
- What makes you different?  
- **Structure**: Name, clear heading, supporting sentence, navigation links

MISSION

- What is my operating principle?  
- **Structure**: 2-4 short sentences, plain language with no jargon  
- **Example**: My goal is to build things that are understandable, maintainable, and useful. I enjoy exploring ideas quickly while keeping enough structure to support growth and long-term ownership. This site exists to document how I think, what I build, and how I approach problems.

	  
	SITE NAVIGATION

- Where should I go next?  
- Tiles or bullets for each major page on my website

	  
EXPERIENCE SNAPSHOTS

- **Structure:** One sentence snippets of my projects   
- 1-2 logos or project highlights  
- Keep it subtle

CALL TO ACTION

- You want the reader to do something, not just stop.

### A Simple Homepage Checklist

If your homepage answers “yes” to these, it’s good:

* Can someone understand what I do in 10 seconds?  
* Does this feel confident without being salesy?  
* Is it obvious where to click next?  
* Does the tone match the rest of my portfolio?

## **Projects** 

### Roadmap
This page will have simple interactive introductions to various projects that I’ve worked on over the years. 
It will contain a fun interactive timeline that can be followed through to gain a deeper understanding of who I am and what I’ve come to learn.

This page will contain brief details on all projects I’ve worked on. It will contain more details on the more important details. 
The user will be able to hover over each item to gain more information

###  Development Frameworks Using AI

“Rapid Project Development Framework”, “They don’t just code — they design processes”  
By showing your structured approach to rapid developmet projects, you demonstrate:

* Process ownership  
* Intentional experimentation  
* Pattern recognition  
* Ability to systematize creativity  
* Adaptation to modern tooling & workflows

Frame it as: **A structured rapid-development workflow**  
Keep it tight and scannable. Showcase “Projects built using this system”  
Explain:

* Why you started doing this  
  * Fast prototyping  
* What problem it solves  
  * Reliable outcomes  
* Why structure matters even in “vibe coding”  
  * Predictable control

---

## **Deep Dives**

	This page will highlight the top 3 major projects that I would like to display to anyone interested. This page will contain these questions and are non-negotiable and correct:

* What problem were you solving?  
* Why did the problem matter?  
* How did you approach it?  
* What solutions did you implement?  
* What tradeoffs did you make?

Consider the following:

* Constraints: Every strong project has constraints. Call them out.  
  * Time constraints  
  * Skill gaps  
  * Platform limitations  
  * Performance requirements  
  * Scope boundaries  
* Decisions & Tradeoffs: Explain why you didn’t build something else.  
  * Why this tech stack?  
  * Why not a different architecture?  
  * What you deliberately kept simple  
  * What you postponed or cut  
* Iteration History: Show evolution  
  * Initial idea → refined version  
  * Early mistakes  
  * Refactors  
  * Features that didn’t work  
* Failure and Friction: just be honest about what didn't work  
  * Something that didn’t scale  
  * A UX assumption that failed  
  * A technical approach you abandoned  
* Functional Demo: a single demo, don’t overdo it.  
  * Small interactive UI  
  * Controlled feature showcase  
  * Read-only playground  
  * Guided demo flow  
* What You’d Do Next  
  * Performance improvements  
  * Architecture upgrades  
  * Feature ideas  
  * Scaling considerations

---

## **Skills**

	This page will contain segments of skills that I’ve developed or worked on over the years. Each segment will highlight how I’ve developed the skill and in what environment. Some segments will even contain tiny demonstrations. 

**Each module:**

* Is small  
* Is scannable  
* Shows evidence  
* Can be interacted with (hover, click, expand)

#### **Example categories**

* Backend & APIs  
* Data & Persistence  
* Frontend & UX (as needed)  
* DevOps & Deployment  
* Systems Thinking  
* Product & Ownership  
* Small Business Ownership

Each category is **clickable or expandable**.

## **Professional Communication / Thinking & Explanation**

### This section will NOT be included in the first MVP draft of my portfolio. I will add this section later when I get farther into presenting myself to future employers.

I record short, focused responses to common technical and behavioral questions to improve clarity, structure, and communication. These examples show how I approach reasoning, tradeoffs, and problem-solving in an interview-style setting. “The value is *your answers*, not the interviewing agent.”

This section will include:

* **3–6 short videos total**  
* Each **2–5 minutes max**  
* Clearly labeled by topic

| How to Frame each video |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **❌** Avoid framing like: “Mock interviews” “Practice interviews” “Interview prep videos” “AI interview simulations” Those sound insecure or junior.  | **✅** Frame it as: Explaining Technical Decisions Thinking Through Problems Structured Interview Responses Technical Reasoning & Communication Demonstrating communication and reasoning. This reframes the content as *capability*, not practice. |

Example video labels:

* “Designing a backend service under constraints”  
* “Debugging a production issue”  
* “Explaining a past technical decision”  
* “Handling ambiguity in requirements”

Do upload:

* Selected clips  
* Focused questions  
* Strong answers  
* Clean delivery

Hiring managers won’t binge-watch — they’ll sample **one**.

## **About / Contact**

This page will be all about humanizing myself, without weakening my professional signal. This page should feel like: “I’d enjoy working with this person.”

### What This Page *Is* For

1. Making you memorable  
2. Showing emotional intelligence  
3. Showing curiosity and balance  
4. Lowering the “unknown factor”  
5. Making it easy to contact you

### Personal Interests/hobbies

frame them as signals, not trivia.

#### **Good examples**

* Creative projects  
* Building things  
* Games / simulations  
* Teaching / mentoring  
* Fitness / discipline-based activities  
* Long-term hobbies

Hiring managers *do* care about this — especially once you pass the initial screen.
