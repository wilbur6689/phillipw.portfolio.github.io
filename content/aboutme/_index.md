# About Me

I'm Phillip Willis, a software engineer who builds things, thinks deeply about problems, and communicates well. This page exists to show you who I am beyond the code—because the best work happens when you enjoy working with the person behind the keyboard.

## Who I Am

I'm a software engineer with a unique background: I spent years as a plumber and maintenance worker before transitioning into backend development. That combination shapes how I think—I approach technical problems with the same mindset I used to diagnose a broken water heater: systematically, practically, and with an eye toward what actually needs fixing versus what looks impressive.

I've worked at companies like Nike and LiveOne building backend services, and I'm currently co-founding Orayh Security, where we're building PhishJitsu—a phishing simulation platform for small businesses. I also run a 3D printing business and co-own a cleaning service, because apparently I like keeping busy.

**What makes me different:** I balance rapid experimentation with structured development. I'm not afraid to ship an MVP and learn from users, but I also won't let technical debt pile up until it collapses. I think about maintainability from day one, even when prototyping.

## Personal Interests & Hobbies

These aren't just hobbies—they're signals of how I think and work.

### 🎙 Pursuit of an Audience Podcast
**Time Spent:** 1 month (ongoing)

I co-host a podcast on YouTube where we discuss topics relevant to small business owners and people in tech. We explore the intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, and practical business challenges.

**What this shows:** I can communicate complex ideas clearly, facilitate discussions, and create structured content. If I can explain technical concepts on a podcast, I can definitely write clear documentation or explain architecture decisions to stakeholders.

### 🖨 3D Printing & Modeling
**Time Spent:** 5+ years

I've been 3D printing since before it was mainstream. A year ago, I turned it into **Primal Solutions LLC**, a small business creating unique home decor items. I design models, optimize print settings, manage inventory, handle customer service, and ship products.

**What this shows:** Long-term commitment to technical crafts, ability to turn technical skills into business value, and patience for iterative improvement (because every 3D print teaches you something about layer adhesion, support structures, or why your bed wasn't level).

### 🔌 Micro-Electronics & Hardware
**Time Spent:** 2+ years

I build custom input devices using Arduino and microcontrollers. Projects include:
- Custom 3D-printed button boxes for sim racing
- Racing pedals with load cell sensors
- Small IoT devices and automation projects

**What this shows:** I don't just live in the abstract world of software. I understand hardware constraints, physical interfaces, and how the bits and bytes actually interact with the real world. This makes me better at building software that runs on actual devices with actual limitations.

---

### 🎲 Game & Systems Design
**Time Spent:** Couple years

I love designing board games and video game mechanics. I've never finished a major project (yet), but I enjoy the design process—balancing systems, playtesting mechanics, and iterating on ideas.

**What this shows:** Systems thinking and an appreciation for how small changes cascade through complex systems. Game design teaches you about feedback loops, edge cases, and user experience in ways that directly translate to software architecture.

---

### 🛠 Maintenance & Helping Others
**Time Spent:** Most of my adult life

I spent years as a professional plumber and still help friends and family with maintenance work—plumbing, electrical, drywall, you name it. I co-own **Clean Willow Solutions**, a residential and commercial cleaning service.

**What this shows:** Reliability and a service-oriented mindset. When someone's pipes burst at 2am, you show up and fix it. That same reliability translates to on-call production support, incident response, and just being someone your team can count on.

---

### 🪵 Woodworking
**Time Spent:** Off and on throughout my adult life

I have access to a workshop with various woodworking tools. While I haven't tackled major projects, I enjoy building things with my hands and the satisfaction of working with physical materials.

**What this shows:** Patience for craftsmanship and appreciation for the difference between "good enough" and "done right."

---

### 🎮 Gaming with Friends
**Time Spent:** Most of my life

I play open-world crafting survival games, simulators, and party games with friends. It's how I unwind and stay connected with people across the country.

**What this shows:** I understand game mechanics, user experience, and what makes interfaces intuitive (or frustrating). Also, I'm a human being who knows how to relax.

---

### ⛪ Church Service
**Time Spent:** My whole life

I volunteer a few hours a week at my church and recently became a leader in the youth program. Most of my service has been teaching children's Sunday school.

**What this shows:** Commitment to community, experience teaching and mentoring, and the ability to explain complex concepts (theology or otherwise) in ways kids can understand—which is excellent practice for making technical docs accessible.

## Why This Matters

You're not just hiring my technical skills—you're hiring how I think, how I communicate, and whether I'm someone you'd want to work with for the next few years. These interests show:

1. **I build things** (3D printing, electronics, woodworking)
2. **I communicate** (podcast, teaching, documentation)
3. **I run businesses** (multiple small ventures)
4. **I help people** (service work, mentoring, teaching)
5. **I think in systems** (game design, architecture, process optimization)

## What You Can Expect

If we work together, here's what you get:

- **Clear communication** — I explain technical decisions in plain language
- **Ownership** — I take responsibility for my work and see things through
- **Pragmatism** — I balance idealism with "what actually works"
- **Curiosity** — I'm always learning, always experimenting
- **Reliability** — If I say I'll do something, I do it

## Let's Connect

Interested in working together? Have a question about a project? Want to talk about 3D printing, backend architecture, or why SharedPreferences is fine until it isn't?
