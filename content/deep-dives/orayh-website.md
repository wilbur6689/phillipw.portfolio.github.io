# Orayh Security Website & PhishJitsu Platform

**Building a cybersecurity SaaS platform from concept to production**

Great for: architecture, UX, deployment, communication, cloud infrastructure, security-first design

## Overview

*[Placeholder - Add overview of the Orayh Security website and PhishJitsu platform]*

**What to include:**
- Orayh Security, LLC - Co-founded April 2025
- PhishJitsu: Phishing simulation and security awareness training platform
- Target audience: Small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs)
- Focus areas: Healthcare, finance, legal, SMBs with high compliance needs

**Known details from LinkedIn:**
- Cybersecurity Innovation: Building scalable SaaS solutions to defend against phishing (the #1 cause of data breaches)
- Technical Leadership: Architecting and deploying cloud-native infrastructure (React, Node.js, Kubernetes, AWS)
- Product Development: User-centric training modules, analytics dashboards, multi-vector phishing simulations

## Problem Statement

*[Placeholder - What problem were you solving?]*
