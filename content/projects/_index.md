## Development Frameworks Using AI

### A Structured Rapid-Development Workflow

**"Rapid Project Development Framework" - They don't just code, they design processes**

By showing my structured approach to rapid development projects, I demonstrate:

- Process ownership
- Intentional experimentation
- Pattern recognition
- Ability to systematize creativity
- Adaptation to modern tooling & workflows

### Why This Framework?

**Why I started doing this:**
- Fast prototyping enables quick iteration and validation

**What problem it solves:**
- Reliable outcomes through structured approaches

**Why structure matters even in "vibe coding":**
- Predictable control over the development process
